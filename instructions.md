1. Copy folder "template" and name it however you like (don't call it "final") -- like your name. This is your working folder.
2. Open index.html and change the \<title\> to your name
3. Open "sketch.js" and "functions.js"

4. Either come up or find a simple sketch you like (for example on [Open Processing](https://openprocessing.org/browse/?time=anytime&type=all#)) -- Ideally you already have one

5. Try to **refactor** it or parts of it using the principles of functional programming from this workshop
6. Put the simpler functions in "functions.js" and compose your final image in "sketch.js" to preview

7. put the keyword "export" in front of the functions you would like to share in the last step of the workshop
  (If you don't understand this step, don't worry. I can do that myself)

8. Upload your progress (Add your changes, Commit and Push). (Make sure you only worked inside of your folder)
