1. Copy folder "template" and name it however you like (don't call it "final") -- like your name. This is your working folder.
2. Open "sketch.js" and "functions.js"
3. Inside "sketch.js" try to understand the compositional nature of the demo() function. Notice the layers, how functions are nested, to give you full control over the behavior of the entire sketch within a composed function that feels like a malleable interface.
4. Play with the values and the functions
5. Go to 'functions.js' and understand the single functions
6. Try to come up with your functions and export them "export const = <your function>" (see examples in ./functions.js)
7. Expand the sketch by replacing the nested functions in the demo with your functions or try to wrap the function in another function to create another layer of composition. Notice how this process can be repeated infinetely and you don't lose control.
8. Upload your progress (Add your changes, Commit and Push). (Make sure you only worked inside of your folder)
